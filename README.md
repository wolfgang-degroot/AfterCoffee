## A fast, low-power, scriptless flat-file CMS â˜•
It needs no installation and is self-contained- Letting you put as many installations you want in as many different folders as you need.

It has a pleasantly low footprint in both size and bandwidth, making hosting on slow networks easy. *A page without images will use just about **10 KB** of bandwidth.*
Being flat-file, means it uses no database- guaranteeing portability if you need to move your build around.

### Features

### Color Pallete Swapping
To tune colors in the default CSS, a Windows Terminal-like structure is used.
To quickly turn [Windows Terminal theme](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev) JSON into valid CSS, use this Regex Replace-with:

Replace `"  "([a-z]*)": "(#\w*)",?"` with `"--$1: $2;"`

#### Potential Issues
If your installation only outputs a blank page, check if `mb_strlen()` is enabled.
If not, Parsedown cannot run, and AfterCoffee cannot run at all. Enable it.

If you cannot save new pages, create folders, or change settings- Recursively allow all folders to have the write permission, or `0777`.
